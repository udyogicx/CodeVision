            <p align="justify" style="padding-left: 70px;padding-right: 70px;">A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a graph G where all edges are directed and not containing any cycles. Representing the set of runtime instructions executed by a processor on behalf of a multithreaded program as a DAG is called a computation DAG.A multithreaded recursive algorithm also can be represented as a computation DAG. The intention of this project is to develop an application to represent the computation DAG for a given multithreaded recursive algorithm or recursive algorithm.</p>

            <p align="justify" style="padding-left: 70px;padding-right: 70px;">The main objective of this project is to Provide a pictorial view for an algorithm which can be used to identify instructions running parallelly. Representing a multithreaded recursive algorithm as a computation DAG helps to identify the way of execution of the algorithm as a simple graph. It can be used to identify the time needed to execute the algorithm. (i.e. work) Computation DAG is useful to identify the longest time needed to execute the threads along any path in DAG. (i.e. span)</p>
